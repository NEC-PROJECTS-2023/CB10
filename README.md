Surveillance Based Attendance System

A technology-based solution called a surveillance-based attendance system enables businesses to monitor employee attendance by using security cameras or other kinds of sensors.
Facial recognition technology is used by the system to identify workers as they enter and depart the building, doing away with the need for time clocks or sign-in papers for manual attendance monitoring. 
The technology works by taking pictures of employees' faces and matching them with employee profiles in a database using facial recognition algorithms. This enables the system to precisely track employee time and attendance and keep an eye on their movements around the office. 
One of the primary benefits of a surveillance-based attendance system is that it reduces the time and effort necessary to track employee attendance. It also reduces the chance of mistakes or fraud connected with traditional methods of attendance tracking. Yet, there are privacy and surveillance problems with this sort of device.
Some employees may be uneasy about being observed at work, and there is also the potential of data breaches or illegal access to critical information. Therefore, while a surveillance-based attendance system can improve efficiency and accuracy, businesses must carefully examine the possible privacy and security consequences before installing one.
